Here's a short explanation of the issue by @ewoutkleinsmann:\r\n\r\n> ActiveSupport::Concern's class_methods uses const_defined? without a second argument and therefore also searches its ancestors for a ClassMethods module. This results in concerns included in a child class that add class methods to a parent class.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
